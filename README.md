A summary of this research project can be found at Research_Summary.pdf.

* Refactored and implemented a set of analysis scripts in Python and Bash under ROOT framework for 2016’s data of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), including event selection; data and reweighted Monte Carlo simulation comparison; particle truth matching; scale factor computing; particle template fitting; quark/gluon fake rates extraction; and systematic and statistical errors computation on fake rates. <br />
* Reduced the statistical uncertainties of false identification of hadronically decaying tau leptons by more than 3x
